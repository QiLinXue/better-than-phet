### This was tweaked from the original
Many features were edited that better suited my purposes. Installation process is much easier too.
(1) Clone the simulation
```
git clone https://github.com/qilinxue/better-than-phet.git
```
(2) Start an http-server

(3) Open `http://localhost/wave-on-a-string/wave-on-a-string_en.html` (You will probably need to modify this URL based on your HTTP port and relative path.)
